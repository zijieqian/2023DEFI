A series of triangular fins growing bigger toward the center and deepening in color , from white to fire_red , evoked the mountains surrounding the city .

Between these fins stood rhododendrons , primulas , poppies and other plants that originate in China .

It stood on arguably the most challenging triangular site at the Chelsea Flower Show , an area that could be viewed from all sides , meaning nothing could be hidden at the back .

A standout feature of the garden was the use of firered colors .

Usually , the color is difficult to match with green vegetation .

`` I chose red because it signals happiness in Chinese culture , '' Cheetwood said .

`` We were afraid of the color contrast , but we employed red_flowering rhododendrons to echo the theme .
########

And , after all , it looks good . ''

Kelly , a garden_lover from Manchester said the vibrant colors stood out and she loved it .
