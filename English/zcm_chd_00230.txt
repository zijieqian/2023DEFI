Julian Zelizer , professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University , wrote earlier this week on CNN 's website that the vote to repeal and replace the Obamacare `` demonstrates the serious threat that the president , when he is able to work in tandem with the Republican Congress , poses to President Obama 's legacy . ''

`` Despite the conventional wisdom that it is almost impossible to dismantle domestic programs once they are up and running , the House just took a big step toward doing so , '' Zelizer argued .

`` I think Obama 's legacy remains firmly in place because even the changes the Republicans are proposing are taking place within many of the outlines put in place by Obama , and the debate is over the aspects of Obamacare that are seen as costly and intrusive by GOP leaders and conservative activists , but increasingly popular amongst the public , '' Dan Mahaffee , senior vice president and director of policy at the Center for the Study of Congress and the Presidency , told Xinhua .
