About one in five people carry a single copy of the variant , known as KL_VS , that boosts levels of the protein and is associated with longer lifespan and improved heart and kidney function .

They found that participants with a single copy of the gene variant also had a larger brain region known as the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex LRB rDLPFC RRB , which is especially susceptible to shrinkage with age .
