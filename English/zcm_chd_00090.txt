While many trade specialists and economists agree that US protection measures are costly and ineffective , the fact that the measures produce winners and losers is exploited by politicians , according to Lincicome , an international trade attorney .

An analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics , which was cited in the study , found that threats of retaliation using Section 301 failed to achieve even partial success more than half the time ; and even actual retaliation worked less than 20 percent of the time .

`` These outcomes would likely be worse if similar policies were implemented today , owing to increased American integration into the global economy , the proliferation of global supply chains , the rise of other economic powers , and the creation of the WTO , '' Lincicome wrote in the report .

US tariffs imposed $ 1.1 billion in additional costs on US tire consumers in 2011 , and the cost per manufacturing job saved was at least $ 900,000 that year , it said .
