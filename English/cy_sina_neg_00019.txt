Through his engineering degree , he was aware of structures in certain fabrics which can become wider and longer when pulled , unlike normal material such as a rubber band which gets thinner .

He managed to capture this property 's effects through pleating the material and heating it to seal it _ making his prototype clothing washproof , waterproof and even ` crumb proof ' .

As well as saving parents cost and hassle , Mr Yasin said he was concerned about the consequences of mass production of garments on the environment , with 30,000 tonnes of household clothing being binned in the last year alone .

As such , the clothing , which is currently an outerwear garment , is fully recyclable as well as allowing for a range of colors and patterns .

Mr Yasin says the clothing would be ` competitively priced ' and save parents money in the long run , costing tens or hundreds , not thousands of pounds .
