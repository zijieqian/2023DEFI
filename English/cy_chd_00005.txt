Cassini has detected hydrogen molecules in vapor plumes emanating from cracks in the surface of Enceladus , a small ocean moon coated in a thick layer of ice , the US space agency said on Thursday .

The plumes have led scientists to infer that hydrothermal chemical reactions between the moon 's rocky core and its ocean_located under the ice － are likely occurring on Enceladus .

On Earth , those chemical reactions allow microbes to flourish in hot cracks in Earth 's ocean floors － depths sunlight can not reach_meaning the moon could also nourish life .

The plumes are 98 percent water , scientists said , with traces of molecules including ammonia , carbon dioxide and methane .

Hydrogen had previously been `` elusive '' , they said , but its detection shows the moon 's life_supporting potential .

`` Now , Enceladus is high on the list in the solar system for showing habitable conditions , '' said Hunter Waite , one of the study 's leading researchers .

Cassini is on what NASA has described as its `` grand finale '' , since it is running low on fuel , soaring through a 2,400 _ kilometer_wide gap between Saturn and its rings .
