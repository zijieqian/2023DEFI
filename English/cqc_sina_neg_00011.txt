There are some human attributes robots could never replace _ or at least that 's what you might hope .

But one university has brought that into question by replacing one of their teaching assistants with a machine .

Jill Watson , an IBM_designed bot , has been helping graduate students at Georgia Institute of Technology solve problems with their design projects since January .

Responding to questions over email and posted on forums , Jill had a casual , colloquial tone , and was able to offer nuanced and accurate responses within minutes.Her replies included ' yep ! '

and ' we 'd love to ' .

Tyson Bailey began to wonder if Jill was a computer and posted his suspicions on Piazza .

We were taking an AI course , so I had to imagine that it was possible there might be an AI lurking around , ' said Bailey , who lives in Albuquerque , New Mexico .

The bot was named Jill Watson after the IBM Watson analytics system that all her responses come from _ essentially her brain .
########

<EOP> .
########
22
She was trained by Georgia Tech researchers before being thrown into the mix with nine other TAs .
########
23
<EOP> .
########
24
Some students were suspicious at how swiftly she responded .

And once she used the word 'd esign ' instead of ' project ' .

But none actually suspected she was a bot .

And they said many of the TAs are sharp , impersonal , and quick to respond anyway .

The experiment sent shockwaves through the tech industry , with many questioning the ethics of covertly inserting artificial intelligence into real_life situations .
########

<EOP> .
########
32
But Ashok Goel , the computer science professor who designed the project , insisted it was a worthwhile experiment _ and Jill performed a necessary task .
########

<EOP> .
########
34
Students posted upwards of 10,000 messages on forums , taking up professors ' time with routine responses .

One of the main reasons many students drop out is because they do n't receive enough teaching support .

We created Jill as a way to provide faster answers and feedback . '

The bot has helped medical research teams diagnose illnesses in patients .

<EOP> .
########
42
And in 2013 it took on the role of customer service manager .

According to Goel , Jill Watson 's capabilities were far more nuanced than that .
########
45
She answers only to questions that she is 97 per cent certain of the answer to .

Once Watson had a number of potential solutions , it was able to check against its database to make sure the answers made sense .
