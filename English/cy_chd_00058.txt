Frequent surveillance and reconnaissance of China 's coast by US military planes and ships has long been regarded a major hindrance to improving the bilateral military_to_military relationship between the world 's two largest economies .

The Aug 19 encounter of a Chinese fighter jet J_11 and a US Navy surveillance aircraft P_8 off China 's southern coast is the latest reminder of the thorny issue .

While Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby on Aug 22 accused the Chinese People 's Liberation Army 's plane of conducting a `` dangerous intercept '' and described the distance of 30 feet as `` unsafe and unprofessional '' , Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun replied on Aug 23 , saying the Chinese pilot 's operations were `` professional and keeping a safe distance from the American airplane '' .

Yang called the US accusations `` groundless '' and said the Chinese J_11 fighter was conducting routine identification and verification when the US P_3 and P_8 reached a distance of 220 km off China 's Hainan Island .

In his statement , Yang said the large_scale and frequent close reconnaissance by the US of China 's coast is the real danger for air safety and a source for accidents .

Over the years , many US experts , such as Douglas Spelman , a senior advisor at the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Wilson Center , have also described the US ' frequent surveillance of China 's coast as `` provocative '' .

However , at a news briefing at Martha 's Vineyard , Massachusetts , where US President Barack Obama was on holiday , Ben Rhodes , the deputy national security advisor for strategic communications , called the Chinese action `` a deeply concerning provocation '' and said `` what we 've encouraged is constructive military_to_military ties with China , and this kind of action clearly violates the spirit of engagement . ''

The US side , including Rhodes , has clearly not realized the well_known Confucius adage : Do n't do unto others what you do n't want others to do unto you .

To many Chinese , the simple question is how the US would react if the Chinese PLA Navy 's surveillance and reconnaissance planes and vessels started regular and frequent operations near the US coast , such as off Florida , California or New York .

The US Navy 's P_8 Poseidon aircraft spotted off China 's coast on Aug 19 is a new militarized Boeing 737 .

It has been described by the US Navy as the most advanced long range anti_submarine and anti_surface warfare aircraft in the world .

The aircraft conducts regular maritime intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance missions , including in the airspace near China 's coast in the South China Sea .

This is a clear indication that contrary to what the Chinese have expected , the US has been strengthening its reconnaissance off China 's coast instead of reducing it .

On Apr 1 , 2001 , a Chinese PLA Navy J_8 fighter jet and a US Navy EP_3 spy plane collided in mid_air over the South China Sea off China 's Hainan Island .
########

The accident caused the death of Chinese pilot Wang Wei , leaving behind a wife and six_year_old son .
########
36
The EP_3 made a forced landing on Hainan Island , with its 24_crew detained by the Chinese .

The crew members were released on April 11 after the US delivered a letter to the Chinese , stating that the US was `` very sorry '' for the death of Chinese pilot Wang Wei and `` we are very sorry the entering of China 's airspace and the landing did not have verbal clearance '' <EOP> .

A bilateral military_to_military relationship between the two countries has long been lagging behind other dimensions such as trade , education and people_to_people exchanges .

Bilateral trade exceeded $ 500 billion last year , making the two countries each other 's second largest trade partners .
