It took years for the UN Development Program to convince the fishing communities along India 's tropical western coast that the diamond_mesh nets they were using were trapping baby fish , while a square_shaped mesh could allow small fish to escape to maintain a breeding population .

But two years after the new nets were fully adopted , fishermen insist they 're making a difference .

`` The oceans of the planet are in dire need of urgent action , '' said Marina Walter , deputy director for UNDP in India .

That action is even more urgent now that climate change is causing ocean temperatures to rise while waters also become more acidic , causing widespread destruction of coral reefs that sustain a quarter of all marine species .

But conservation efforts work best when they 're linked with local livelihoods , Walter said .

`` You can not work on biodiversity or life underwater in isolation , without looking at the livelihoods of people , the bread and butter .

Located in one of India 's 11 ecologically critical coastline habitats , the area is teeming with life from more than 350 marine species including Indian Ocean dolphins and Olive Ridley turtles .

Colorful corals span the shallows , while tangles of mangrove forests protect the land from water erosion .

But that bounty has suffered against the twin assaults of overfishing and pollution , which caused a steady decline local fish stocks and forced fishermen to push further out to sea .

About one out of every 10 people in the world relies directly on the ocean to survive .

Most of those are among the world 's poorest and most vulnerable , meaning they have few substitutes when marine life declines .

<EOP> .
########
32
And it is declining rapidly , thanks to increased fishing for an expanding global population and unchecked runoff of industrial chemicals , sewage and other pollutants .

Already , about 90 percent of wild fisheries around the world are over_exploited or collapsed .
