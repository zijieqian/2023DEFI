However , the study showed that it is not because of men 's lack of trying _ the male volunteers were given brain scans while they looked at the pictures , and the data suggested an unusual reason for the difficulty in reading women 's feelings .

Commenting on the results of the study , published in journal PLoS ONE , the researchers said : `` As men were more involved in hunting and territory fights , it would have been important for them to be able to predict and foresee the intentions and actions of their male rivals . ''
