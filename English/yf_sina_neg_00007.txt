Will Scotland vote to independence
0
AFTER months in which it looked all but certain that Scotland would vote `` No '' to independence , there is now real concern in London at the possibility of Scotland opting for a divorce this Thursday .

Polls suggest a closer race than many had predicted , with the `` Yes '' campaign for Scottish independence even nudging ahead of the lacklustre `` No '' campaign in some surveys over the past two weeks .

But if Scotland does leave the United Kingdom , what of Wales ?

Would a Scottish `` Yes '' vote prompt calls from the Welsh to hold their own referendum on independence , precipitating the exit of Wales from the Union too ?

In fact , although Wales is in a similar position to Scotland , both in terms of history and its present constitutional arrangements , if the polls are to be believed there is almost no appetite for independence in Wales .

A YouGov poll in April asked Welsh voters : `` Should Wales be an independent country ? ''

, and the answer was a resounding No .

Only 12 % answered positively , with 74 % against LRB and 13 % do n't knows RRB .

Curiously , the same poll showed that more Welsh supported independence for Scotland than for their own country .

Furthermore , that 12 % figure is probably on the high side , as several other surveys have shown support for Welsh independence at more like 5 % .

Not even all supporters of Plaid Cymru , the Welsh nationalist party , are in favour of independence .

If Scotland votes `` No '' on September 18th it will certainly get more powers devolved from Westminster to Edinburgh anyway , and the same is bound to happen to Wales .

But that is not expected to shift the basic Welsh objection to independence much .

There are several reasons for this lack of enthusiasm .

Some worry about Wales 's viability as an independent nation .
########
17
Wales is smaller , with a population of just over 3m , compared with Scotland 's 5.3 m , and nor does it have such an obvious source of income LRB and power RRB as Scotland does with its North Sea oil .

The amount of oil and gas left in the North Sea for an independent Scotland to exploit is hotly disputed , but it nonetheless adds weight to the argument of the `` Yes '' campaign that Scotland can go it alone financially .

Wales used to be a great coal_producing country , but most of that industry is long gone .

These might be termed negative reasons to stay in the Union , born of a well_founded fear of how Wales might do on its own .

But the Welsh also have more positive reasons to stay in the Union than do the Scots , principally because they seem to be more comfortable with their dual identity as Welsh and British .

The Welsh enjoy a high degree of devolved government and combine this with a strong sense of cultural autonomy .
########
23
Thus Wales is officially a bilingual country LRB all the road signs , for instance , are in Welsh and English RRB , and it is estimated that about 20 % of the population speak Welsh .

Wales has distinct cultural and sporting festivals , and a distinct national sport -- rugby football .

Yet despite this firm Welsh identity , Wales is closely linked to England both economically and politically -- more so than Scotland .
########
27
Telephone records reveal that whereas the Scots mainly talk to each other , the Welsh are mainly chatting to the English and others outside Wales .
########
28
Furthermore , the Welsh are proud of the contribution that their own politicians have made to building modern Britain .
########

David Lloyd George was British prime minister during the latter half of the first world war , and Aneurin Bevan , from Monmouthshire , founded the National Health Service in the Labour government immediately after the second world war .

Conversely , the Welsh have been more accepting of English politicians occupying Welsh seats ; Labour Party leader Michael Foot sat in Bevan 's old seat at Ebbw Vale for decades .
########
31
It is only in more recent years , since the 1990s , that Scotland has consistently produced politicians that rose to the top of Westminster politics LRB such as Gordon Brown , prime minister in 2007_10 RRB .

Whichever way the Scots vote , it looks as if the United Kingdom will at least hang on to Wales .
