Assange , 45 , had been accused of rape in Sweden and , until Thursday , was the subject of a European Arrest Warrant issued by the Swedish prosecutor .
########

However , the Swedes announced they were halting their investigation and withdrawing the warrant because they were unable to question Assange directly or bring him before a court .

The Australian_born WikiLeaks founder , who jumped bail after an initial appearance on the Swedish request in front of a British judge in 2012 , sought asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in West London .

He said he feared being extradited to the United States after WikiLeaks released more than 20,000 classified documents that had been passed to his organization by US Army intelligence specialist Bradley Manning , who was subsequently jailed for 35 years before being pardoned by President Barack Obama just before he left office .

The Times newspaper reported this weekend that Assange wanted to ask France for help in arranging that safe passage , either by granting him asylum status _ a move lawyers here said was unlikely , given France 's close ties with the UK _ or by arranging safe passage under Ecuadorian protection to a French airport from where he could be put on a direct flight to Quito .

Lawyers said one solution would be an immediate appearance in front of a standing magistrate who has the power to deal with the offence , either with a suspended sentence , or a small fine , on condition he leave the country .

Last month , United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions said prosecuting WikiLeaks and Assange was a top priority , although during his election campaign last year , President Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks for its role in releasing documents relating to rival Hillary Clinton 's campaign .

He hailed the lifting of the Swedish arrest warrant as a victory and has always denied the rape allegations , saying the sex with the two women in Sweden was consensual .
