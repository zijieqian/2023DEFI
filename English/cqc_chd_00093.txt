China played a critical role in the slower growth of global energy demand and consumption as well as the nearly flat growth of carbon emissions in 2016 , according to the latest BP world energy report .

The report says that a relentless drive to improve energy efficiency is causing global energy consumption overall to decelerate .

The energy mix is shifting toward cleaner , lower carbon fuels , driven by environmental needs and technological advances .

Global energy consumption grew slowly again in 2016 _ the third consecutive year in which demand has grown by 1 percent or less _ much weaker than the rates of growth over the previous 10 years or so , according to the report titled <EOP> .

The weak growth in energy demand , combined with a continuing shift toward lower_carbon fuels , meant global carbon emissions from energy consumption were estimated to have been essentially flat in 2016 for a third consecutive year _ a substantial improvement relative to past trends , the report says .

`` From a global level , much of this improvement can be traced back to the pronounced changes in the pace and pattern of economic growth and energy consumption within China , '' BP Group CEO Bob Budley said in the report .

Energy consumption in China grew by just 1.3 percent in 2016 .

Its growth during 2015 and 2016 was the lowest over a two_year period since 1997_98 , according to the report .

China , however , remained the world 's largest growth market for energy for a 16th consecutive year .

Spencer Dale , BP Group chief economist , praised effective Chinese government policy launched in 2016 to reduce coal production .

`` For those of you interested in the Chinese policy , it 's magnificent , '' he said on Thursday at the Atlantic Council in Washington .

China was the key driver of the growth of global renewable energy last year , accounting for more than 40 percent of the growth in renewable power , more than the entire OECD put together .

China also overtook the US as the largest producer of renewable power .

Dale believes China is the key to understanding the flat growth of global carbon emissions and whether that trend is structural or just temporary .

Some structural changes happening in China include slower economic growth , a change in the structure of economic growth away from energy_intensive industrial sectors toward the consumer and service sector , and a shift in the fuel mix away from coal toward more renewable energy , nuclear power and natural gas , according to Dale .

`` Those trends are structural trends and are likely to persist , '' he said .

He also pointed out that the fall of China 's energy demand was also due to the weakness reflected in the iron , steel and cement industries , which together account for a quarter of China 's energy demand .

Dale , who was executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England before joining BP in 2014 , expressed how much this is going to structural and how much it is going to be temporary adjustment is still hard to tell .
