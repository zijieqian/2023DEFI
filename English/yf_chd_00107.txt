Rogue Waste Systems went to Oregon 's Department of Environmental Quality to seek help in managing the recyclable materials they were forced to store outside after using all indoor capacity .

The agency agreed to allow about a dozen waste collectors like Rogue to put the excess material in landfills , said Peter Spendelow , an environmental specialist at DEQ .

Spendelow said US waste processors have lacked the incentive to clean up recyclables , which are often mixed with contaminants , because buyers in China pay by weight .

The ban might create more environmental problems for China if Chinese manufacturers are forced to use more virgin materials , which Spendelow said require more energy to make and can cause more pollution , Biderman said .

Some in the US recyclables industry argue that China has the right to initiate the ban , but that it 's not distinguishing between waste and recyclables when it refers to yang laji , or `` foreign waste '' .
