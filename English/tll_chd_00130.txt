Huang Bin , vice_president of AstraZeneca China , which built a $ 230 million factory inside the Medical City , said the company was attracted by CMC 's partnership with China 's drug regulating agencies , which helped the company 's drugs get approved in China .

To attract more British companies such as AstraZeneca , CMC launched its UK incubator in London .

It is CMC 's third overseas incubator , after openings in the US and Germany earlier this year .

But unlike its 30 square kilometers Taizhou laboratory_dominated facility , CMC 's central London incubator is just a regular office for meetings between Chinese and British life science companies , regulators and investors .

`` The UK has unparalleled cutting edge life science technology , highly complementary to China 's commercialization and production strength and massive domestic market , '' said Luke Zhou , director of CMC_UK Incubator .

Built in 2010 , CMC hosts around 700 pharmaceutical and life science companies , such as AstraZeneca , Japan 's Takeda and Germany 's Boehringer_Ingelheim .

Zhou said CMC 's key attraction to UK life science companies is its existing collaboration with Chinese regulators , including the Ministry of Health , the China Food and Drug Administration and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine .

Perhaps what makes CMC more attractive is its `` established ecosystem , including its collection of life science companies and talents '' , said Will Addison , founder of London_based Apta Biosciences .

`` We want to first enter China by finding a good partner , and hopefully we can do it at CMC , '' said Addison , who just returned from a visit to CMC .

`` Some life science companies may wish to keep their core research and development team together , so CMC could improve their value proposition if they have a physical lab space in the UK where British companies can work with Chinese investors and partners who come to the UK , '' Crane said .
