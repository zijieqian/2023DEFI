Satellite observations during five Octobers show Earth 's artificially lit outdoor area grew by 2 percent a year from 2012 to 2016 .

Light pollution is actually worse than that , according to the researchers .

Their measurements coincide with the outdoor switch to energy_efficient and cost_saving light_emitting diodes , or LEDs .

Because the imaging sensor on the polar_orbiting weather satellite ca n't detect the LED_generated color blue , some light is missed .

But light pollution is almost certainly on the rise in those countries given this elusive blue light , said Christopher Kyba of the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences and lead author of the study published in Science Advances .

More and more places are installing outdoor lighting given its low cost and the overall growth in communities ' wealth , the scientists noted .
