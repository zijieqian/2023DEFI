The move comes at a time when the Korean Peninsula had become calmer .

For more than two months , Pyongyang has refrained from conducting any missile and nuclear tests .

The US ' designation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terrorism could lay waste to the efforts of China and Russia to bring the DPRK back to the negotiation table .

Instead , it could be used by Pyongyang as a pretext to renew its weapons tests , thus restarting the vicious circle of escalating tensions on the peninsula that had seemed in danger of spiraling out of control .

Trump has based the designation on the alleged killing of Kim 's half brother Kim Jong_nam by DPRK agents at Kuala Lumpur airport in February .

The latest US move only serves to fan that fear － given what happened to Iraq and Libya － and does a disservice to easing the already tense situation on the peninsula .

Instead , as China said on Tuesday , `` more should be done '' to resolve the crisis through dialogue .
