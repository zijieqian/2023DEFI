In San Pedro , groups of men and women `` macheras '' defy wind and tide to wade thigh deep into the winter ocean , feeling for the bump of the shellfish in the sand with their bare feet , before reaching down and grappling under the water for the reclusive clam .

He has to put on 20 pounds of lead to anchor himself to the sand and resist the waves so that the sea does n't move him around , '' said Zepeda .

Once out of the water , the machas are sent to a production center managed by the fisherman 's cooperative , to be sorted for size and shipped to restaurants and stores .
