To determine how effective the lesson plans were in actually improving sleep quality among students in the course , Shatkin and his colleagues compared sleep quantity and quality between NYU students enrolled in the class in the fall 2014 semester and NYU students enrolled in coursework other than the sleep course .

They found sleep for the students taking `` While You Were Sleeping '' did , in fact , improve .

Students enrolled in the sleep course slept 22 minutes longer per night on average two months after taking the course compared with their sleep before the course , and the students fell asleep nine minutes faster per night after the course , according to the findings , which were presented at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 's annual meeting last year .

And better sleep hygiene for all of the students was associated with fewer depressive symptoms -- meaning the results imply that the course , by improving sleep , could also help decrease depression and anxiety , Shatkin said .
