The temptation to eat fatty foods is often so strong that , for many , they ca n't resist eating fatty or sugary foods even if they are trying to cut down on calories .

Now , researchers believe capsaicin could provide a solution to this problem ; speeding up the metabolism without the need to restrict the diet .

University of Wyoming researchers found capsaicin may stimulate the body to burn energy and create heat LRB a process known as thermogenesis RRB _ burning off calories in the process .

It does this by activating receptors in the body which set off the process of energy burning .

These receptors are found in white and brown fat cells .

In the body , white fat cells soak up calories and store them as fat _ the dreaded type visible in pot bellies , love handles and wobbly thighs that is the enemy of dieters .

Brown fat , found in small amounts on the shoulders and neck , actually burns fat to heat the body _ and is therefore known as ` good ' fat .

The researchers found that capsaicin in the diet was able to stimulate a receptor called potential vanilloid 1 LRB TRPV1 RRB channel protein .

Activating this receptor suppresses obesity associated with a high_fat diet , the researchers found .

They believe this is because it induces ` bad ' white fat cells to become energy_burning ` good ' brown fat cells .

The researchers carried out the study on one group of wild mice , and another group of mice who had been genetically engineered to lack the TRPV1 Receptor .

Capsaicin prevented the weight gain associated with eating a high fat diet in the wild mice , but not the mice that lacked TRPV1 .

` It did significantly increase the metabolic activity and energy expenditure in wild type mice fed a high_fat diet , but not for mice that genetically lack TRPV1 , ' researcher Vivek Krishnan , of University of Wyoming 's School of Pharmacy said .

This is because the fiery ingredient induces ` bad ' white fat to become ` good ' , energy_burning brown fat and also stimulates the body to create heat , he added .

This may help to prevent and manage obesity and other related health complications such as Type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure , and cardiovascular diseases , the researchers said .

Next , the researchers want to further understand the mechanism by which capsaicin prevents obesity , and carry out more trials to further prove that it can help manage weight .
