If , as US Pacific Command chief Harry Harris claimed , THAAD is expected to be operational `` in the coming days '' , there is little chance of it being suspended because of protests from Beijing and Moscow , even though it comes at a time when Washington and its allies want them to commit more comprehensively and deeply to coordinated moves .

Although the official excuse has been Pyongyang 's wayward stuntsmanship and the threat it poses , making THAAD a fait accompli and pre_empting any change of mind from the next administration in Seoul may be a more powerful driver behind the rush to get THAAD up and running in the ROK .

Of course , Beijing and Moscow have valid reasons to protest , because the advanced system upsets the regional strategic balance and its radar undermines Chinese and Russian security interests , even though both the US and the ROK claim otherwise .

Beijing and Moscow are in the same boat with Washington and its regional allies on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula thanks to a shared security interest .

And in the White House 's latest rhetoric on Korean Peninsula denuclearization , China and Russia are referred to as `` partners in the region '' , indicating unprecedented eagerness for a united front .

Beijing , however , has been identified as crucial to dissuading the DPRK from continuing along the path it has chosen .

So much so that Washington seems to believe that Beijing alone can make a dramatic difference .

Beijing , on its part , has been consistent in adherence to diplomacy and pursuing a nuclear_free peninsula with the united efforts of all stakeholders .

Washington and Seoul claim Beijing is misreading the situation and overreacting , but that is because they are not willing to take Beijing 's concerns seriously and have not looked at the matter from Beijing 's perspective .
