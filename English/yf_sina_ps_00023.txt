Can a blood test predict whether someone may attempt suicide
0
A blood test that can predict whether someone may attempt suicide has been developed by scientists in a breakthrough which could prevent hundreds of deaths .

American researchers have found that variations in a single gene can be used to predict if someone is likely to take their own life .

Researchers at John Hopkins University , in Baltimore , Maryland , found that the gene SKA2 stopped functioning correctly in people at risk of suicide .

The SKA2 gene is found in the prefrontal cortex of the brain , and is involved in preventing negative thoughts and controlling impulsive behaviour .

If there is n't enough SKA2 , or it is altered in some way , the body can not control levels of cortisol .

Previous research has shown that people who attempt suicide or who take their own lives have large amounts of cortisol in their systems .

A test could allow doctors or psychologists to place patients on ` suicide watch ' and restrict their access to drugs or equipment which they could use to end their own life .

`` Suicide is a major preventable public health problem , but we have been stymied in our prevention efforts because we have no consistent way to predict those who are at increased risk of killing themselves , '' says study leader Dr Zachary Kaminsky , an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences .

The blood test managed to predict those with the most severe risk of suicide with 90 per cent accuracy .
