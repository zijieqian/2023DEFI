He suggested that one option could be the sonic weapon , known as the Long Range Acoustic Device LRB LRAD RRB , an acoustic device that can emit sounds over great distances , which has been used in the US to disperse protests , but an LRAD would have affected several entire buildings , and also could not be targeted so specifically .
