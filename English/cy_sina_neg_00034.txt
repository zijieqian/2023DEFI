When Lindsay Jernigan , an American expat in China , noticed how often Chinese professionals had -- for lack of a better term -- `` stripper '' names like Candy and Cherry , she wanted to find a way to help them out .

This is a common way for Chinese people to introduce themselves when interacting with foreigners . ''

This practice dates back to the beginning of China 's rapid ascension to economic superpower .

As East got to know West , cross_cultural communication required that the given name be relevant and easy .

If you ever take the leap to learn a little Chinese , your first month of lessons will most likely be just learning the alphabet LRB called Pinyin RRB that goes along with the characters .

Herein lies the problem with Chinese names -- trying to pronounce Qian or Xiu is not a simple phonetic exercise .

Like our Spanish class experience , many of them pick these names when they first start to learn English .

Those names become email addresses ; they appear on business cards , name tags , even job applications , and , therefore , these names can stick with them for a long time .

The English naming culture is wildly different to the Chinese naming culture , leading to a total misunderstanding as to how to pick an English name .

We laugh when we hear Chinese with names like Furry , Eleven or Mars , but if you understand the Chinese naming culture , you will understand how they can adopt these names with a straight face .

The main , overarching issue is that Chinese people are taking their own Chinese naming practices and using them to choose an English name .
########
27
Here are some naming practices unique to Chinese and how they might affect English name choice .

A Chinese given name can also be any word or character .

There is not a strong distinction between a regular word and a name .

This is why the Boat 's , Mars 's , and Genius 's exist .

Chinese is a much more complex language than English .
########
34
They have a whole other level of language rooted in the characters .
########
35
These characters , while very intimidating , are actually intricate and beautiful representations of words and meaning .
########
36
There is actually even a level of Feng Shui in these characters called the Five Elements .
########
37
It is important for these elements to be balanced .
########
38
The elements are Fire , water , stone , metal , and wood .
########
39
If you have a lot of Fire , you might want some water in your English name , so you pick Ocean !

In China you can have a variant of a name that quite literally no one else has .

no	13	neg_cue

It can be a very unique character with a meaning deeply rooted in your family 's values .

So oftentimes Chinese people will try to find a name that no one else has and invent a name himself or herself , like Harevil .

Yes , this is a real life example .

########
46
Chinese people put a lot of emphasis on the meaning of a name .
########
47
This is a key difference that is often hard for Chinese people to understand .
########
48
For example , Kendall -- a really cool and strong name -- actually means `` Valley beside the River Kent . ''
########
49
So instead people will often opt for the literal and choose a name like Beauty , Paradise , or Smile .

In creating BestEnglishName.com I have spent a lot of time understanding these cultural differences as expressed through names .
########
52
I completely understand how English names can be confusing .

For example , Violet is a beautiful name , color , as well as flower , but neither Green nor Hydrangea are accepted as English names .

The name Taylor can be for a girl or a boy , but Gary is strictly a name for a man .
