`` It 's such a peculiar animal , '' said Dennis Voeten , a paleontology researcher at Palacky University in the Czech Republic .

`` It combines different parts we knew from other groups into this one small animal . ''

In a study released on Wednesday by the journal Nature , Voeten and co_authors named it Halszkaraptor escuilliei or `` Halszka '' after the late Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmolska .

Paleontologist Kristi Curry Rogers of Macalester College in St. Paul , Minnesota , who did n't participate in the study , called it `` a pretty crazy chimera : a swan neck and dinosaur body , but with a mouthful of tiny teeth and hands and feet that look like they might be good for swimming '' .

Its mashup body let it run and hunt on the ground and fish in fresh water , said study co_author Paul Tafforeau .

He 's a paleontologist at the ESRF , known as the European Synchrotrona , a powerful X_ray generator , in Grenoble , France , where numerous tests were made on the fossil .

Lead author Andrea Cau , a paleontologist at the Geological Museum Capellini in Bologna , Italy , said he was at first highly suspicious about the fossil 's authenticity , both because of its appearance and the fact that the rock containing the skeleton had been smuggled out of Mongolia and left in a private collector 's hands .

So researchers used the Synchrotron to create three_dimensional images of the fossil , which showed the creature was indeed a single animal and not a concoction built up from several sources .

For example , an arm hidden in the rock perfectly matched the visible left arm .

Even though the creature was n't dreamed up by Doctor Seuss , it got a blessing from a Doctor Sues .
