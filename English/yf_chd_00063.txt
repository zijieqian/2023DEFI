After reading the two presidential documents , I 've found a striking resemblance in them : the unprecedented emphasis laid on innovation , an area I believe the two countries have as much , if not more , to cooperateon rather than compete .

The US is by far the world 's biggest spender : It poured 2.8 percent of its gross domestic product into RandD in 2015 , when China 's spending was 2.1 percent , according to the 2015 UIS Innovation Data Collection , the latest survey released by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics in April .
