We must seize this opportunity .

The dynamics between China and the rest of the world is undergoing profound changes .

The third opportunity will arise from dovetailing development strategies of our two countries .

########
214
The fourth opportunity lies in the extensive , friendly exchanges between China and Britain .
########
215
<EOP> .
########
216
Recent years have seen increasing cultural and people_to_people exchanges between our two countries .
########

Together , we hosted the China_UK Year of Cultural Exchange .

In the field of education , about 170 thousand Chinese students are right now studying in the UK .
########
223
More than 130 thousand British students have been registered at the 29 Confucius Institute and 145 Confucius Classrooms across the UK .
########
224
This has made Britain a leader in Europe in both student exchange and Chinese language teaching .
########
225
<EOP> .
########
226
Tourism is another highlight .
########
227
In 2016 , Chinese and British nationals made 1.5 million visits to each other 's country .
########
228
That is 50 % more than five years ago .
########
229
<EOP> .
########
230
Greatly facilitating such level of mutual visits is the increase of passenger flights between China and Britain to 100 flights per week .
########
231
<EOP> .
########
232
Such level of close cultural exchanges and people_to_people ties is certainly contributing to stronger public support on both sides for China_UK relations .

Last but not least is the opportunity for cooperation between China and Britain on international issues .
