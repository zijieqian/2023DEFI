Researchers suggest people who wrongly believe they are overweight may be more likely to engage in unhealthy weight_control behaviors such as using diet pills or vomiting _ and these , in turn , are linked with long_term weight gain .

` Our research shows that psychological factors are important in the development of obesity , ' said study author Angelina Sutin , a psychological scientist at Florida State University .

In previous work , Dr Sutin and her study co_author , Antonio Terracciano , had found that people who were judged on their weight were more likely to be obese .

Extending these findings , they wondered whether individuals ' own perceptions of their weight might be just as harmful , especially during the teenage years .

This enabled them to examine the height , weight , and body image thoughts of more than 6,500 young people when they were 16 and 28 years old .

At age 16 , the participants were asked to rate how they thought of themselves in terms of weight , with response options ranging from very underweight LRB a score of 1 RRB to very overweight LRB a score of 5 RRB .

The researchers were specifically interested in looking at the outcomes for teenagers who saw themselves as overweight , even though they were a healthy weight by medical standards .

Compared to those who perceived their weight accurately , young people who wrongly perceived themselves as being overweight had a 40 per cent greater risk of becoming obese as adults .

But why would seeing themselves as heavier than they actually are predispose teens to later weight gain ?

As well as being more likely to adopt unhealthy behaviours such as using diet pills or vomiting , these people may also have less self control , the study suggests .
