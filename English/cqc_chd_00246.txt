The Mar_a_Lago resort in Florida , which is far from the `` serious '' Washington DC , set the meeting apart from the traditional political decision making , and removed it far from American bureaucracy , said Sergey Trush , a leading member of the Center for Regional Problems of the Institute for US and Canada Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences , who also fully agreed that the Xi_Trump meeting was a success .
