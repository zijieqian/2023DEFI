Last week , the UK published a policy document proposing two possible models for British_EU customs arrangements after withdrawal from the EU in 2019 .

The first model was a `` highly streamlined customs arrangement '' which involved the re_introduction of a customs border but which envisaged electronic tracking of shipments , rather than physical checks of goods and documents at the border .

An alternative proposal was the `` new customs partnership '' which would remove the need for a UK_EU customs border altogether .

The EU 's system of movement of goods across EU borders without checks works on the basis that all members closely monitor shipments coming into the bloc from outside , to ensure the correct tariffs are paid and that goods meet EU standards .

The EU anti_fraud agency OLAF polices customs agencies across Europe to ensure they are correctly monitoring imports .

OLAF has the powers to conduct on_the_spot inspections and seek information from customs bodies .

If OLAF finds weaknesses in a country 's systems and that the member is not charging the appropriate duties on imports from outside the EU , it will recommend that the European Commission , the EU 's executive arm , should recover money from the offending member .

For example , in March OLAF slammed lax UK border controls and recommended the European Commission reclaim 2 billion euros LRB # 1.82 billion RRB the agency said was lost because Britain had failed to apply the correct EU duties on imports of Chinese clothes and footwear in recent years .
