Hepatitis is a major global public health challenge _ around 400 million people carry the disease , which caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015 , according to the World Health Organization .

Hepatitis B is present in China , where 90 million people are infected .

At just one atom thick , graphene is among the world 's thinnest materials , and has several useful properties .
########
27
It is flexible and nearly transparent , it efficiently conducts heat and electricity , and it is 200 times as strong as the strongest steel .

Graphene was first observed through an electron microscope in 1962 , though research into its application in a number of industries only began in earnest in 2004 , following its isolation in a lab at the University of Manchester .
