WASHINGTON _ For fans of the yeti , newly published genetic research on purported specimens of the legendary apelike beast said to dwell in the Himalayan region might be too much to bear _ literally .

Scientists have said that genetic analysis of nine bone , tooth , skin , hair and fecal samples from museum and private collections attributed to the yeti , also called the Abominable Snowman , found that eight came from Asian black bears , Himalayan brown bears or Tibetan brown bears .

`` This strongly suggests that the yeti legend has a root in biological facts and that is has to do with bears that are living in the region today , '' said biologist Charlotte Lindqvist of the University at Buffalo in New York and Nanyang Technological University , Singapore , who led the study published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. <EOP> .

The researchers sequenced mitochondrial DNA , genetic material in structures within cells passed down from mothers , of purported yeti samples from China 's Tibet autonomous region , India and Nepal as well as from black , brown and polar bear populations .

`` I initially became involved in this study when I was contacted about a previous study that found two purported yeti samples to match genetically with an ancient , 120,000 _ year_old polar bear that I was doing research on , '' Lindqvist said .

`` But the data was very limited , and it made me suspicious about the speculation that the yeti legend represented some strange , hybrid bear roaming the Himalaya Mountains .

The brown bears roaming the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and those in the western Himalayan mountains appear to belong to two separate populations separated from each other for thousands of years , despite their relative geographic proximity , Lindqvist said .
