Scotland is one of the world 's major suppliers of farmed salmon but the industry 's growth was recently hampered by sea lice infestations that led to a drop in production .

Sea lice are a parasite that latches onto fish , seriously affecting their growth .

Such fish are usually harvested before their health deteriorates , when they tend to be younger and smaller .

Figures from the United Kingdom 's HMRC Revenue and Customs showed the export volume of salmon to China fell from around 11 million kilograms in 2015 to 8 million kilograms last year , something the industry attributes to the sea lice outbreak .

In 2014 , some 13 million kilograms of the pink_fleshed fish was shipped to the world 's second_largest economy .

Despite the fall in the quantity of exports to China , the value of the industry remained high .

In 2016 , the value of salmon exports was around 52 million pounds LRB $ 67 million RRB .

In the previous year , it was 53 million pounds .

Scott Landsburgh , chief executive of the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation , said : `` Sea lice are nothing new , they exist in the wild and climate change is contributing to the spread .

Landsburgh attributed the fall in the volume of exports entirely to the early harvest .
########

<EOP> .
########
33
`` China likes the larger fish , around 7 kilos , but there was an early harvest last year in order to provide healthy and high_quality salmon , which resulted in smaller fish .
########
34
That is why exports to China dipped a bit in 2016 . ''

But Landsburgh expects business to pick up this year and anticipates increased productivity in the years to come , thanks to cooperation between regulators and the Scottish government as they look for ways to better meet the demand for salmon in a sustainable manner .
