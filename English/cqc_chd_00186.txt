Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is using the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula to its advantage .

The Japanese media are playing up the nuclear and ballistic missile tests by the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , making Japanese people more apprehensive of the threat from Pyongyang .

This in turn has created a public perception that the Abe administration has no choice but to deepen its military cooperation with the United States to protect Japan against external threats .

As a result , many Japanese have to come to believe that only a stronger US_Japan alliance can stop the DPRK from pursuing its nuclear programs .

The Japanese administration has been hyping the threat from the DPRK instead of trying to ease public tensions .

And Abe 's remarks and some media reports have made many in Japan believe that the country will bear the brunt of a conflict , if one were to break out .

The fear among Japanese people therefore can be mainly attributed to the exaggerated propaganda of Abe and the media .

Amid the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula , Abe has delivered many sensational speeches and taken moves that could stir up more trouble .

Addressing a recent meeting of the parliamentary panel on national security , Abe even said Pyongyang might already have the resources and technical know_how to develop and fire missiles equipped with sarin nerve gas .

The message he tried to convey is that , since Pyongyang has the capability to launch chemical attacks on other countries , the US should join Japan to launch a military strike in order to preempt a possible attack by the DPRK .

Besides , the Abe administration has also been talking about how its Self_Defense Forces will cooperate with the US military if a conflict with the DPRK were to break out .

Perhaps Japan is hyping up the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue to use it as an excuse to dispatch its Self_Defense Forces to help the US in a conflict with the DPRK .

Japan 's new national security law came into effect in March last year , allowing it to exercise the right to dispatch Self_Defense Forces to defend the country or a friendly country facing attack .

As a result , Tokyo can now provide strategic help for the US and other allies even if Japan itself is not attacked .

The purpose of this law is to enable Japan 's Self_Defense Forces to take part in conflicts in other parts of the world , albeit on the side of its allies , on the pretext of helping friendly countries in trouble .

Now that Abe has freed the Self_Defense Forces of the restrictions of Article 9 of the Constitution , Japan can pretend to be a `` normal country '' .

That will also lay the foundation for Japan 's next step , which is to amend the Constitution , and boost its strategic strength to become a major military power .

And since the Self_Defense Forces have not found a chance to take part in actual combat after the new security law came into force , Japan sees the DPRK issue as an opportunity to exhibit as well as test its military strength .

Thus it can be safely concluded that the hyping up of the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue is a well_planned move by Abe to stir up trouble , even a conflict , in the region .
