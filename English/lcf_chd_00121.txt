The bots were designed by Chinese start_up Geek + to bring goods to workers , saving them from trawling up and down kilometers of racking to complete orders .

China has been the world 's major buyer of industrial robots since 2013 , according to the International Federation of Robotics LRB also known as IFR RRB .

In 2009 , the global market for industrial robots extended to 60,000 units .

That figure ballooned to 294,000 units in 2016 , when China alone ordered 87,000 units .

The IFR forecasts that , by 2020 , more than 1.7 million new industrial robots will be installed in factories worldwide .

Ocado is in discussion with supermarkets in China and elsewhere that are interested in purchasing its hardware and software , which is collectively known as the Ocado Smart Platform .

Paul Clarke , chief technology officer at Ocado Technology , said : `` The platform has been designed from day one to offer large bricks_and_mortar retailers around the world a shortcut to moving online .

We 've been talking to grocery retailers around the world in almost every continent .

In that mix , China certainly features . ''

Ocado 's main warehouse in Hatfield , Hertfordshire , reveals a timeline of the company 's technological evolution .
########

<EOP> .
########
46
In the oldest section of the warehouse , a computer program indicates to employees what goods are needed for an order .
########
47
Pickers then select items manually.In a newer section , a vast network of conveyer belts and cranes controlled by an algorithm deliver goods directly to workers who sort them into bags .

The Ocado Smart Platform in Andover is the latest iteration of the company 's move toward full automation , though humans pickers are still needed to put the finishing touches to orders .

Nathan Wrench , head of industrial and energy projects at Cambridge Consultants , which worked with Ocado on the smart platform , said : `` What we are seeing is a period of extraordinary change .

There is mad innovation happening across the value chain .

Autonomous trucks and vans are being spoken about .

We are also seeing robotics being used for other elements of manual handling within warehouses , such as getting goods into vehicles . ''

In the UK , the rise of warehouse robots has led to employment concerns .

A study conducted by the Institute for Public Policy Research estimates robots will replace one_in_three UK jobs during the next 20 years .

It has called on the UK government to provide job training to low_skilled workers who are at risk of losing their employment to machines .

However , Clarke points out that , as Ocado 's operation has grown , the company has employed more people in its warehouses .
########
68
And Wrench argues that many companies in the UK are struggling to find enough employees to undertake certain tasks .

`` There is this fanciful idea that robots are going to come along and take jobs away and there is going to be a crisis of employment .
