A few , though , have held out the possibility that a Powell_led Fed will feel compelled to step up the pace of rate hikes as inflation finally picks up and the economy , perhaps sped by the Republican tax cuts , begins accelerating .

At his Senate confirmation hearing last month , Powell impressed his listeners as an evenhanded moderate who favored the kind of incremental stance toward rate hikes that both Yellen and her predecessor , Ben Bernanke , embraced .

A Senate committee approved Powell 's nomination and sent it to the full Senate , where his confirmation is considered certain .

In his view of the Fed , Trump has made clear that he favors low rates .
########

But the president has also expressed a desire to pull back on many of the regulations that were imposed on banks after the 2008 financial crisis .

Trump and many Republicans argue that those regulations are too burdensome , especially for smaller banks .

Powell himself has sent some signals that he agrees .

It was in the midst of the 2008 crisis that the Fed cut its key rate to a record low near zero and left it there for seven years .

Eventually under Yellen , the Fed responded to a steadily improving job market and economy by modestly raising the rate -- in December 2015 , in December 2016 and now three times this year .

Wednesday 's rate hike was the Fed 's first since June .

The policymakers left rates alone through the summer and fall as they puzzled over why inflation had slipped farther below their 2 percent annual target .

It 's unclear whether the Fed is taking account of the likelihood that Congress will pass tax cuts and perhaps cause the economy to accelerate next year .
