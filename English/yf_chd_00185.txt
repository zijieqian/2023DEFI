`` Some believe that some part of the corporate debt actually is debt issued by the local government established entities , '' Jin told the IMF executive board on Wednesday during a discussion of the IMF report Financial Sector Assessment Program LRB FSAP RRB for China .

In an online press briefing on Wednesday evening , Ratna Sahay , deputy director of the IMF Monetary and Capital Markets Department , called China 's looming debt a major risk in its financial system .

She described the sustained credit expansion as being of a magnitude that in other countries has been associated with financial distress .
########
12
`` This has resulted in high corporate and local government debt .
########
13
And household debt is also rising at a fast pace , '' she said .
########

<EOP> .

The IMF cited the rapid credit growth as a result of China 's focus on maintaining economic and employment growth .

The IMF report noted that this debt is largely owed by companies _ some of which may not have good prospects _ and local governments , but an increasing share is owed by households .

`` Credit growth is an important indicator of future financial distress , because lending standards often fall in the rush to make more loans , '' the report said .

According to Jin , the purpose of raising the debt by local government entities is to fulfill their responsibility to implement urbanization and infrastructure development .

`` In China , the local governments take a lot of responsibilities , but their ability to mobilize resources through taxation or bond issuance is limited , '' he said .

`` In that case , part of the corporate debt is actually local government debt , '' <EOP> .

Jin believes it is necessary to revise down the corporate debt ratio and increase local government leverage ratio accordingly .

<EOP> .

28
`` The official public sector 's debt over GDP is quite low , only 40 percent .
########
29
`` If you add the hidden local government contingent debt , that may increase the total public debt over GDP ratio , and the corporate sector debt will decrease by the same amount , '' he said .

`` In the end , what really matters is the total leverage ratio in China , which includes the government debt , corporate debt and the household debt '' , he said .
########

<EOP> .
########
33
The total leverage ratio in China is 260 percent of GDP , which is still lower than most of the advanced countries and is comparable with many emerging_market economies , according to Jin .

Sahay admitted at the press conference that there has been some effort in measuring the debt more carefully , and the IMF is revising the numbers .

`` So this part of the corporate debt will be attributed to the local government , '' she said in response to China Daily .

Huang , a former World Bank country director for China , has acknowledged the role played by many established local government entities .

He also has said that a lot of the credit has been funding the increased value of land and property , and if these property values are stable , the increase in credit is not an issue .

The IMF 's FSAP report for China also pointed out the complexity of China 's financial system by saying that rules on bank lending to traditional sectors , such as construction and real estate , have pushed risky borrowers away from banks and toward more lightly regulated financial products .

The IMF claimed that banks often compensate investors for losses on financial products to preserve their reputations .
########
48
It said the Chinese government has repeatedly intervened to stabilize financial markets and investors have come to believe that state_owned enterprises will be bailed out if they get into trouble .

`` But protecting investors and companies from losses encourages them to underestimate risk and can lead to a misallocation of investment to less productive economic activities , '' Sahay said in an analysis with her colleague James Walsh .
