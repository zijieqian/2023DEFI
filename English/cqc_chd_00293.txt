A closed_loop nuclear fuel cycle for these reactors suggests that they will independently generate their own supply of plutonium , a nuclear fuel being reproduced with non_enriched uranium feedstock .

Therefore , the reactor 's operating modes and its specifications need to be designed in such a way as to make the reactor self_sufficient , to provide it with the required amount of fissionable isotopes and to maintain the reactor during its service life .

In an effort to accomplish this , the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI LRB NRNU MEPhI RRB has teamed up with the National Research Center Kurchatov Institute and developed the REPRORYV LRB Recycle for PRORYV RRB software package , which simulates nuclear fuel_handling processes outside reactors .

In addition , REPRORYV helps fast neutron reactors operating under the so_called two_component nuclear power concept to independently produce their own fissionable materials , that is , together with `` heat '' neutron reactors , the mainstay of the modern nuclear power industry .
