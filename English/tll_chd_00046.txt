The results of their work will make it possible to more accurately assess intra_coal changes during storage , transportation and use , to predict spontaneous combustion risks and to calculate factual heat release properties .

The properties of extracted coal tend to deteriorate slowly after extraction because of atmospheric influence , fluctuating temperature and humidity levels .

The quality of coal is impaired by various processes , and coal may lose up to 20 percent of its heat release properties during combustion .

Coal consumption is therefore higher than necessary , leading to higher heat and power generating costs .
########

Specific waste volumes also increase , thus increasing air pollution .
########

This is why new mechanisms for appraising intra_coal processes and coal properties are needed to more effectively use minerals after they have been mined .

NUST MISIS is implementing a large and comprehensive project to study the structure of coals , their properties , and their `` behavior '' during the entire cycle , from mining to incineration .

Experts observe the coal disintegration process during rising ambient temperatures and inside an inert medium utilizing argon gas .

According to the scientists , new approaches for studying the coal_oxidization mechanism could seriously influence the development of the Russian coal industry , its pricing policies on the coal market and the environment of coal_mining regions .
