What I suspect is that your attention is so wholly focused on the romantic partner you do n't get to see the other folks you had a lot to do with before , and so some of those relationships start to deteriorate . ''

In a separate study , Dunbar 's team looked at how men and women maintained friendships on the social networking website Facebook .

They found that women 's Facebook friends were more often friends from everyday life that they spent time with , while men tended to collect as many friends as they could , even if they hardly knew them .

One of the cues women use for male quality as a mate is the number of other girls chasing them , so signing up lots of girls as Facebook friends seems to be a good idea , '' said Dunbar .
