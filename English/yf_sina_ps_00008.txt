Is there a Comet 67P
0
A European robot probe has made the first , historic landing on a comet , but its status is uncertain after harpoons failed to anchor it to the surface .

The `` first '' landing on Comet 67P_Churyumov_Gerasimenko was confirmed at about 1605 GMT .

There were cheers and hugs at the European Space Agency LRB Esa RRB mission control in Darmstadt , Germany , after the signal came through .

Director general Jean_Jacques Dordain described it as `` a great great day , not only for Esa , but ... I think for the world '' .

Further analysis is needed to fully understand the status of the probe , known as Philae .

However , Lander project manager Stephan Ulamec told the BBC that at last radio contact with the probe , he believed it to be in a stable configuration .

Early data started to come back from instruments , and one team could see that the lander had sunk about 4cm LRB 1.5 inches RRB into the surface , suggesting a relatively soft top layer <EOP> .

But shortly after , engineers could see that the harpoons , designed to fasten the spacecraft to the 4km_wide LRB 2.5 miles RRB ball of ice and dust , had not fired as planned .

In a later media briefing , Dr Ulamec said : `` What we know is we touched down , we landed at the comet at the time when you all saw us cheering and when it was announced .

`` We had a very clear signal there ; we received data from the landing _ housekeeping and science data .

That 's the good news . ''

But then Dr Ulamec delivered the `` bad news '' .

This subsequently came to an end , which the German Space Agency official interpreted as a possible `` second landing '' on Comet 67P .

In fact , even later data would indicate that the Philae robot may have bounced twice , taking a full two hours to come to a rest .

This bouncing was always a possibility , but had been made more likely by the failure of the harpoons to deploy , and the failure of a thruster intended to push the robot into the surface .

But the news about the unanchored state of Philae has cast a shadow over the celebrations .

The mission team must decide if the harpoons can now be commanded to fire without unsteadying the robot still further .

What is clear is that Philae touched down very close to the targeted zone on the head of the rubber_duck_shaped comet .

If Philae remains stable and can be properly secured , it will engage in several months of science experiments on 67P .
