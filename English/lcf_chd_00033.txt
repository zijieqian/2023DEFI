But it is now being transformed to accommodate and reflect other Chinese communities and to keep up with the changing profile of the Chinese in the United Kingdom .

`` We 're seeing now lots of students from the Chinese mainland hanging out in Chinatown .

London 's first Chinatown was in the east of the city , close to its docks .

It migrated to its current location in the 1970s , when rents were cheap and Soho was a byword for crime and prostitution .

It is a bustling network of traditional dim sum restaurants , old fashioned barber shops , grocery stores , and gambling places but now also features shops selling Taiwan bubble tea , matcha ice cream , and Instagram_friendly bubblewrap waffles .

Soho has become more popular and expensive since the 1970s and small businesses now find it hard to afford the rent .

He is skeptical about whether newcomers will be able to succeed there because of the high overheads .
