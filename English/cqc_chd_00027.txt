Clarkson 's paper was published in the journal Nature , which last month turned the understanding of human origins on its head , with a study showing fossils discovered in Morocco to be 300,000 years old , about 100,000 years older than any other human remains previously found .

The Australian study used both radio_carbon dating , which reaches its limits at around 50,000 years , and luminescence , which uses laser beams , to date 28,500 individual grains of sand from the site , which sits on a Rio Tinto uranium mining lease in the Northern Territory .

`` Previous excavations , they did n't have the access to the dating methods that we do these days to actually confirm that the deposits and the archaeology really were that old , '' said Andy Herries , Associate Professor of Palaeoanthropology and Geoarchaeology at La Trobe University in Melbourne , who was not part of the study .

`` The problem previously was that there was some old dates and stones but it was just a couple of them , whereas this research shows a significant occupation , '' he said .
