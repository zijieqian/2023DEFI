Scientists from China and the United Kingdom have successfully used gene editing to make pigs leaner , improving their overall health and making them cheaper to feed .

A team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing used CRISPR_Cas9 gene editing technology to introduce genes from mice into pig embryos , resulting in young with 24 percent less body fat .

Pigs carry white fat _ or lard _ and are not capable of producing brown fat , which is better for insulation .

They found the modified pigs stayed warmer in cold temperatures .

Brown fat takes less energy to create so the pigs have a better `` feed conversion ratio '' _ they need less food to grow .

`` Pork is the number one meat consumed in China , so it 's an important industry , '' said Zhao Jianguo , a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and an author on the report .

`` China spends a lot of money trying to improve economic production and efficiency in the pig industry . ''

In the CRISPR_Cas9 system , special proteins act as a molecular `` copy and paste '' tool , targeting precise areas of DNA and removing or inserting genes .

Scientists have observed such proteins at work in the natural world for decades , and were first able to artificially replicate the system in human cell cultures three years ago .

The new research was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States .

The sale of animals that have undergone gene editing is not yet licensed in China , though Zhao said the cutting_edge technology has the potential to become commonplace .

Many crops , including the majority of the world 's soy and maize , are now genetically modified after techniques were first developed in the 1980s , Zhao noted .

China accounts for half of all global pork consumption .

It is restructuring its pig sector to boost domestic supply .

Imports of pork have grown at an annual rate of 150 percent since 2007 .
########
34
UK pork exports to China amounted to 76,000 metric tons last year , compared with 2,000 tons in 2007 , making China the biggest export destination for British pork for the first time .

The pork industry in China is moving away from small production units to larger operations that invest in genetic and technical advancements .
########
37
The hope is this will make it easier to control disease and improve herd health , reducing reliance on foreign imports .
