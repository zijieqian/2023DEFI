Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have found evidence in the outer solar system of an object that could be a real ninth planet .

Nicknamed Planet Nine , it `` has a mass about 10 times that of Earth and orbits about 20 times farther from the sun '' than Neptune .

That means `` it would take this new planet between 10,000 and 20,000 years to make just one full orbit around the sun , '' according to Caltech .

Researchers Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown have n't actually seen the planet , but other research helped lead them to conclude that there is one .

Basically , they found that certain objects in the Kuiper Belt __ the field of icy objects and debris beyond Neptune __ had orbits that peculiarly pointed in the same direction .

Over time , mathematical modeling and computer simulation led them to the conclusion that a planet was exerting the gravity necessary to shape these orbits .

Brown says `` there have only been two true planets discovered since ancient times , and this would be a third .

Already , Caltech is pretty confident Planet Nine is large enough to rule out any debate about whether it 's a true planet __ unlike Pluto , which got the boot in 2006 .

Brown , who played a role in Pluto 's demotion to a dwarf planet , says `` all those people who are mad that Pluto is no longer a planet can be thrilled to know that there is a real planet out there still to be found .

Depending on where Planet Nine is in its `` bizarre , highly elongated orbit , '' many telescopes have a shot at finding it .

Brown would love to find a planet he helped discover , `` but I 'd also be perfectly happy if someone else found it .
