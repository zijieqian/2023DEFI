By preventing the wearer from slouching , the clothes help people improve their posture in the long run .

The concept is simple _ every time you slouch , the shirt will tighten uncomfortably around the back , forcing you to sit upright again !

They began by identifying the various sitting and standing positions that cause neck , shoulder , and back pain .

Heiligers then cut the fabric across the back , in order to make the clothes tighten slightly when the wearer slumps forward .

He chose to use only a minimum palette of colors _ white , grey , navy _ because he wanted to create an everyday collection .
