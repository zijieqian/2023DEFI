All of that suggested that the plane most likely crashed farther south into the Indian Ocean than previously thought , Australian officials also said , leading them to announce a shift farther south within the prior search area .

But a month later , officials conceded the wreckage was not in that concentrated area , some 1,600 km LRB 1,000 miles RRB off the northwest coast of Australia , and the search area would have to be expanded .
