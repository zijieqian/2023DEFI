A `` stunning '' fossil find in northwest China by a team of British and Chinese paleontologists has revealed the bizarre and unique anatomy of the world 's first trees .

The exceptionally well_preserved discovery in an arid plain in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region revealed that the Earth 's first trees _ known as Cladoxylopsidas _ had more complex physiology than any modern varieties .

The findings were published in the United States journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , and co_authored by paleontologists Chris Berry , from Cardiff University in the UK , and Xu Honghe of the Chinese Academy of Sciences .

The fossilized trees grew more than 370 million years ago in the mid_Devonian period , when the seas teemed with fish and the land was populated by plants and crawling creatures , such as mites , scorpions and early insects .

The fossils reveal an interconnected web of woody strands within the trunk of the Cladoxylopsidas that is much more intricate than that of trees growing today .

`` There is no other tree that I know of in the history of the Earth that has ever done anything as complicated as this , '' Berry said .

`` This raises a provoking question : why are the very oldest trees the most complicated ? ''

The woody strands , known as xylem , are responsible for conducting water from a tree 's roots to its branches and leaves .

In most modern trees , xylem forms a single cylinder to which new growth is added in rings year by year just under the bark .

########

The fossils show the first trees had their xylem dispersed in strands in the outer five centimeters of the tree trunk only , while the middle of the trunk was completely hollow .

The narrow strands were interconnected to each other like a finely tuned network of water pipes .

`` The tree simultaneously ripped its skeleton apart and collapsed under its own weight while staying alive and growing upwards and outwards to become the dominant plant of its day , '' Berry said .

The Chinese Academy 's Xu discovered the first fossil in 2012 and the second , larger and better_preserved fossil in 2015 .

He went back to the site a year later with an excavation team to unearth the one_ton relic .

Berry said : `` I 've been working on fossil trees of this age for 20 years .

Previously discovered fossils had hinted at the complex anatomy of the Cladoxylopsidas , though none were in good enough condition to provide definitive evidence .

The trees in prehistoric China had fossilized in ideal circumstances , with silica from volcanic particles precipitating inside the plant cells , locking them in time .

Cladoxylopsidas did not have leaves .

Berry said it 's not yet confirmed how they photosynthesized adding that the trees ' unique structure maybe the result of how the smaller plants from which they evolved functioned , as well as a lack of competition in the environment from large , leafy trees .
