MIAMI _ It 's been called the `` most mysterious star in the universe '' , bigger than the sun and yet brightening and dimming in an odd way that suggested to some an alien megastructure might be circling it .

But a study released on Wednesday , compiled by more than 100 scientists who have been observing the star named KIC 8462852 , puts the alien rumors to rest .

`` Dust is most likely the reason why the star 's light appears to dim and brighten , '' said lead author Tabetha Boyajian , assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University , for whom `` Tabby 's Star '' is nicknamed .

The initial discovery of the star was made with the help of NASA 's planet_hunting space telescope , known as Kepler .

Kepler detects planets by tracking moments when a star 's light dims as an object passes in front of it .

The unusual dips in brightness in Tabby 's Star _ more than 1,000 light_years away , about 50 percent bigger and 1,000 C hotter than the sun _ aroused global interest .

Citizen scientists , known as Planet Hunters , were the ones who discovered the star 's strange behavior , by sifting through massive amounts of data from the NASA Kepler mission .

`` If it was n't for people with an unbiased look on our universe , this unusual star would have been overlooked , '' Boyajian said .

`` We were hoping that once we finally caught a dip happening in real time , we could see if the dips were the same depth at all wavelengths , '' said co_author Jason Wright , assistant professor at Pennsylvania State 's department of astronomy and astrophysics .

Even though the team has ruled out any massive alien construction as the cause of dimming , `` it raises the plausibility of other phenomena being behind the dimming '' , Wright said .

Researchers said the experiment is indicative of a new era in astronomy , in which crowd_sourcing and citizen scientists help fuel new discoveries .
