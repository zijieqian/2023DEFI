We greatly value the APEC forum for the ample opportunities it affords all participants to engage in discussions and coordinate positions on a variety of economic , social , environmental , and cultural issues .

Our countries strive to cooperate based on the principles of consensus and voluntary participation , mutual respect and willingness to compromise , regardless of the political situation .
########

This is what APEC 's unique spirit of partnership is all about .

As a major Eurasian power with vast Far Eastern territories that boast significant potential , Russia has a stake in the successful future of the Asia_Pacific region , and in promoting sustainable and comprehensive growth throughout its entire territory .
potential	13	ps_cue

We believe that effective economic integration based on the principles of openness , mutual benefit and the universal rules of the World Trade Organisation is the primary means of achieving this goal .
########

<EOP> .
########
15
We support the idea of forming an Asia_Pacific free trade area .
########
16
We believe this is in our practical interest and represents an opportunity to strengthen our positions in the rapidly growing APR markets .
########
17
I want to note that over the past five years , the share of APEC economies in Russia 's foreign trade has increased from 23 to 31 percent , and from 17 to 24 percent in exports .
########
18
And we have no intention of stopping there .

Of course , the large_scale project to create the APEC free trade area should be carried out with due account of the experience gained from implementing key integration formats in the Asia_Pacific region and Eurasia , including the Eurasian Economic Union , in which Russia cooperates with Armenia , Belarus , Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan .

Our union has been developing dynamically , and we are eager to build relations with all countries and associations that are interested in doing so .
########
22
Vietnam , the host of this year 's Forum , was the first state to sign a free trade agreement with the EAEU .
########
23
As a result , our trade grew significantly and became more diversified .
########
24
Talks on a trade and economic cooperation agreement with China concluded a short while ago .
########
25
Talks with Singapore have begun , and we are working on the possibility of signing a free trade agreement with ASEAN .

Comprehensive development of infrastructure , including transport , telecommunications and energy , will serve as the basis for effective integration .

Today Russia is actively modernising its sea and air ports in the Russian Far East , developing transcontinental rail routes , and building new gas and oil pipelines .
########
33
We are committed to implementing bilateral and multilateral infrastructure projects which will link our economies and markets .
will	11	ps_cue
########
34
Among other projects , I am referring to the Energy Super Ring that unites Russia , China , Japan , and the Republic of Korea , and the Sakhalin_Hokkaido transport link .
########
35
<EOP> .
########
36
We pay special attention to integrating Russia 's Siberian and Far Eastern territories into the network of APR economic ties .
########
37
These efforts include a whole range of measures to enhance the investment appeal of our regions , and to integrate Russian enterprises into international production chains .
########
38
<EOP> .
########
39
For Russia , the development of our Far East is a national priority for the 21st century .
########
40
We are talking about creating territories of advanced economic growth in that region , pursuing large_scale development of natural resources , and supporting advanced high_tech industries , as well as investing in human capital , education and healthcare , and forming competitive research centres .
########
41
<EOP> .
########

We hope that our foreign partners , primarily from APEC economies , will play an active role in implementing these programmes and projects .

All the more so , as foreign participants of the annual Eastern Economic Forum held in Vladivostok already had a chance to gain confidence in the prospects and feasibility of our plans .

We have an equally serious approach to involving small and medium_sized businesses in APEC economic integration processes , and supporting female entrepreneurship and start_up companies run by young entrepreneurs .
########
46
Of course , we attach special importance to strengthening our cultural ties and expanding our contacts in the sphere of science and education .
########
47
Looking ahead , we will focus on forming a common APR education space , one of whose centres could be the Far Eastern Federal University .

These include unifying digital economy and trade rules , harmonising national technical standards , coordinating strategies for forming high_tech markets , and creating a uniform conceptual framework for the digital space .

We have also shared with our partners our experience in providing e_services to the public .

In addition , we suggest starting consultations within APEC on international information security and protection of computer software .

Preventing and providing relief following natural disasters and man_made accidents , epidemics and pandemics is another challenge that requires a joint response by all APR partners .
########
56
Of course , we need to tackle food security issues together and think about how to meet the region 's rapidly growing demand for high_quality and healthy food .

Russia is one of the world 's leaders in exports of grain , vegetable oils , fish , and a number of other foods .
