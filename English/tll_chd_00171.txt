First , just as the ancient Silk Road that brought benefits to China , Central Asia , the Middle East , Africa and Europe , the `` Belt and Road '' is guided by the spirit of openness and constructive cooperation .
########
58
Against rising protectionist and anti_globalization sentiments around the world , and even advocating and implementing of trade protection measures by some , it is in all our interests that China and the EU stay committed to free trade and economic openness , to a rules_based , transparent and fair international trading regime and order ; and join in our shared desire to open up markets , oppose protectionism and secure greater connectivity and economic development and prosperity .
