Concerning the issue of citizens ' rights , the two sides were still at loggerheads with each other .

The only silver_line of the sitzkrieg was that Britain had informed EU of its intention to put in place a simplified procedure which allows EU citizens to assert their rights .

`` Today I can confirm that we want to reassure those European citizens living in the UK that their rights and status will be enshrined in UK law by the Withdrawal Agreement .
