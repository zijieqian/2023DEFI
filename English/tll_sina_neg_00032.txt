The results , in the journal Science , showed two thirds of the cancer types analysed were caused just by chance mutations rather than lifestyle .

Old tired cells in the body are constantly being replaced with new ones made by dividing stem cells .

But with each division comes the risk of a dangerous mutation that moves the stem cell one step closer to being cancerous .

They concluded that two thirds of cancer types were `` due to bad luck '' from dividing stem cells picking up mutations that could not be prevented .

`` If two thirds of cancer incidence across tissues is explained by random DNA mutations that occur when stem cells divide , then changing our lifestyle and habits will be a huge help in preventing certain cancers , but this may not be as effective for a variety of others .
