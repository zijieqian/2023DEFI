Instead , he sprays his skin with a mist containing live bacteria , which he claims has kept him clean all these years ÔºÅ <EOP> .

Dave Whitlock , a chemical engineer and MIT graduate , says that there is no basis for assuming that bathing is a healthy practice .

In fact , he says that the chemicals in our soaps and shampoos have destroyed all the friendly bacteria that once inhabited our skin and kept us clean .

Whitlock first started thinking about good bacteria when a woman he was dating asked him why horses liked to roll around in the dirt during summer .

`` The only way that horses could evolve this behavior was if they had substantial evolutionary benefits from it , '' Whitlock explained .

That 's when he realised that for the horses , this was actually a way of keeping clean .

Until then , no one had considered that skin bacteria was important and could be helpful to the body .

But he went ahead and invented a one_of_a_kind spray _ called ` Mother Dirt AO + Mist ' _ consisting of ` good ' bacteria .

According to Whitlock , the bacteria in the spray can serve as personal groomers , eating through sweat and oil on our skin .

They feed off urea and ammonia in the sweat from the skin , turning them into nitric oxide , which is very good for the body .

Nitric oxide molecules dilate blood vessels and help regulate blood pressure , along with a host of other benefits .

The spray is manufactured through AOBiome , a company that Whitlock helped found .

According to the company , `` Modern hygiene has selectively depleted the natural balance of the skin microbiome particularly affecting AOB .

By restoring the appropriate AOB levels , we believe a range of human health conditions could be impacted . ''
