About 80 % of plane crashes are caused by human error , she adds .

The U.S. military already flies Global Hawk drones , which are nearly the size of a the widely_used Boeing 737 passenger jets .
########
10
And military data shows that drone flights crash less often than piloted flights , Cummings said .

But so far businesses working on drones are looking only at non_passenger uses , like making deliveries or taking aerial pictures .

Airlines could save trillions of dollars over the life of their aircraft just by switching from a two_person flight crew to a single pilot , Cummings said .

Once there 's only a single pilot aboard an aircraft , she said the planes will have to be able to operate without a pilot in case the pilot is incapacitated .

A pilotless plane is at risk of getting hacked .
########

But experts say that hacking risk can be kept very small and will be worth the risk .

He says hacking poses less of a risk to fliers than a hijacker or rogue pilot .
