The key message of the Congress is that Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is entering a New Era , which is marked by four new developments .
########
16
<EOP> .
########
17
There is , first of all , new development in theory .
########
18
<EOP> .
########
19
The Congress has adopted Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era .
########
20
This is the latest adaptation of Marxism to Chinese conditions .
########
21
It is the CPC 's understanding of the laws of social progress and it answers the question of how to adhere to and continue building socialism with Chinese features .

########
22
As in the past , the CPC is determined but not rigid ; it is always ready to learn but never copy blindly ; and it is committed to blazing its own trail in line with China 's national conditions and the trend of the times .

Then there is a new priority .
########
25
<EOP> .
########
26
This is to address unbalanced and inadequate development in order to meet the people 's ever_growing needs for a better life .
needs	16	ps_cue
########
27
As a Party believing in putting people first , the CPC has solved the subsistence issue for over one billion people and is leading the nation to achieve moderate prosperity .
########
28
Now the focus will be on satisfying people 's growing needs for greater democracy , rule of law , justice , security and a better environment and achieving well_rounded development for every individual and social progress in all respects .

Thirdly , there is a new timetable and roadmap for China 's development in the coming decades .
########
31
<EOP> .
########
32
These are the goals of building a moderately prosperous society by the 100th anniversary of the CPC in 2020 , realizing socialist modernization by 2035 , and building China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced , harmonious and beautiful by the middle of this century when the People 's Republic celebrates its 100_year anniversary .
########
33
<EOP> .
########
34
Above all , there is a new central leadership .
########
35
<EOP> .
########
36
As we say , great cause requires strong and firm guidance .
########
37
In a massive country like China , development and progress would be impossible without strong leadership .

China has become stronger and wealthier .

What will this mean for the world ?

The 19th CPC National Congress has highlighted three new missions of a stronger and wealthier China .
########
43
<EOP> .
########
44
The first is to blaze a new path for state_to_state relations .
########
45
<EOP> .
########
46
This path differs from the trajectory of traditional powers , because China has been and will always be a staunch force upholding world peace .
will	15	ps_cue
########
47
A stronger and more developed China will never seek hegemony or expansion .
will	6	ps_cue
never	7	neg_cue
or	10	ps_cue
########
48
Our vision for the world is for everyone to come together and build a shared future for all mankind .
########
49
To this end , we will hold high the banner of peace , development and win_win cooperation , and promote a new type of state_to_state relations based on mutual respect , fairness and justice , cooperation and mutual benefit .
will	5	ps_cue
########
50
The old logic that `` the winner takes it all '' or `` strength leads to hegemony '' has no place in the 21st century where countries should embrace dialogue and partnership and reject confrontation and alliance with one against another .

The second mission is to make new endeavors for human progress .
########
53
<EOP> .
########
54
China has been and will always be a force for global development because we have the confidence and capability of not only getting things done at home but also bringing along other countries .

55
Around the world , China is forging partnerships , expanding common interests and welcoming other countries aboard the `` express train '' of China 's rapid growth ; China advocates an open world economy and promotes trade and investment liberalization and facilitation ; China has launched a new platform for international cooperation and common prosperity with the Belt and Road Initiative ; China has stepped up assistance to developing countries , the least developed in particular , in order to close the development gap and enable balanced and universal growth .
########
56
<EOP> .
########
57
The third mission is to contribute new solutions .
########
58
<EOP> .
########
59
With the theory of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era , China is contributing to the wealth of existing political systems and governance models by offering its path from development to modernization .
########
60
In global governance , China is committed to extensive consultation , joint contribution and shared benefits , and strives to be a force for international order and rules .
########

China respects other countries ' independent choices and will never impose its own will onto others .

The Chinese nation believes in harmony and sharing prosperity .

And we are ready to make the Chinese Dream compatible with the dreams of the world 's people .
