Researchers assessed 13,284 young and healthy Spanish university graduates , average age 37 , to investigate possible links between three types of sedentary behaviour and risk of death : television viewing time , computer time and driving time .

The risk of premature death was twofold higher for those watching three or more hours of TV a day compared to those watching one hour or less .

Prof Martinez_Gonzalez said ` As the population ages , sedentary behaviours will become more prevalent , especially watching television , and this poses an additional burden on the increased health problems related to aging .
