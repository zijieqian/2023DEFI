Did the driver be warned that he is about to cause a crash

Let 's face it , almost all automobile crashes are caused by human error .

But what if there were a way to predict driving mistakes right before they happen ?

That 's the promise of new technology under development by researchers at Cornell and Stanford universities .

While many cars already have sensors and cameras that watch line markings and surrounding vehicles , this new system also uses cameras inside the car to monitor the driver .

Subtle movements of the head and body can indicate that a driver is about to turn or change lanes in the next few seconds .

indicate	8	ps_cue
or	16	ps_cue

With that information , combined with data from sensors outside the car , computers can predict that a driver is going to make a dangerous move .

The driver could then be warned that he is about to cause a crash .

The system could also use GPS data to warn a driver that , say , the turn he 's about to make is illegal at that time of day .

To develop the system , Cornell 's Ashutosh Saxena and his colleagues recorded video of 10 drivers and combined it with video looking forward from their cars as they drove .

In all , almost 1,200 miles of city and highway driving over two months was recorded and analyzed .

Computers learned to correlate certain head and body movements with impending driving maneuvers .

When tested later with a different set of drivers , the technology correctly predicted driving maneuvers 77.4 % of the time .

On average , a turn or lane change was anticipated more than 3.5 seconds before it happened .

More refinement is still needed , according to the researchers .

Drivers interacting with passengers could confound the system .

And some driving situations , like turning from a turn_only lane , do n't always involve the same physical cues .

Eye_tracking capability and more sophisticated cameras could be added for greater precision .

Sensors could be added to the steering wheel and pedals to pick up a driver 's movements .

So far , this technology is in the early stages , but the researchers are in active discussions with automakers , Saxena said .
