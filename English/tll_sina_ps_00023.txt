Arthur Poropat , of Griffith University in Australia , compared measurements of what psychologists call the `` big five '' personality traits -- openness , conscientiousness , extroversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism -- to academic scores , and found that the students who were rated higher in openness and conscientiousness tended to receive better grades .

`` In practical terms , the amount of effort students are prepared to put in , and where that effort is focused , is at least as important as whether the students are smart , '' Poropat said in the release accompanying the paper , which was published in Learning and Individual Differences .

In Dr. Poropat 's research , a student 's assessment of their own personality is as useful for predicting university success as intelligence rankings .

However , when people who know the student well provide the personality rating , it is nearly four times more accurate for predicting grades .

It makes intuitive sense that both conscientiousness and openness would result in higher grades ; it does n't really matter how smart you are if you ca n't manage to turn your homework in on time , for one .

And another word for openness is curiosity , another obviously necessary factor in learning .

Still , it 's an interesting way to think about academic achievement for anyone who grew up believing they did well in school simply because they were `` smart . ''
