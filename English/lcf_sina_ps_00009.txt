When the women doing the survey were in flats , just 25 of the 60 men took part .

A two_inch heel made them more amenable , with 36 out of the 60 that were approached agreeing to answer the woman 's questions .

But when the heels rose to almost four inches , the number of male volunteers rose to 49 out of 60 , or as Professor Guéguen put it : ` Men responded more favourably to the survey request as soon as the length of her heels increased . '

His final experiment involved watching how long it took men standing drinking in a bar to approach a woman sitting alone at a nearby table .

A woman in high heels was chatted up almost twice as quickly as one in sensible shoes , the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior reports .

Professor Guéguen is n't sure why heels make a woman more attractive but he says that it may be by that changes in gait and posture make her seem more feminine .

However , a previous British study found that a man ca n't tell from a woman 's walk whether she is wearing heels .

In any case , the women in the bar were sitting down .

Another possibility is that that the use of high heels in sexy films and adverts has led to men near_automatically associating them with desirability .
