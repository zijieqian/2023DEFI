While the allergen which dogs carry reduces the chance of developing glaucoma _ the second leading cause of blindness in theUK _ owning a cat nearly doubles the risk of contracting the eye disease .

Many pet owners suffer mild allergic reactions to their pets but still choose to keep them .

However the new study suggests that even a small immune response could lead to blindness .

The study by the University of California , Los Angeles , found that cat owners who reacted to their pet allergen had a 90 per cent increased risk of glaucoma compared with non_pet owners .

But dog owners were 20 per cent less likely to develop the debilitation condition .

Keeping a dog also has the added benefit that owners are outside more which has been proven to protect against short_sightedness .

Glaucoma occurs when fluid in the eyeball stops draining efficiently , causing a build_up of pressure which damages the optic nerve and nerve fibres from the retina .

Previous studies have suggested that inflammation can drive the disease and the researchers wanted to find out if that could be triggered by pet allergens .

Animals frequently groom themselves so allergens from saliva and secretions spread throughout the home , becoming airborne easily where they can be inhaled by humans .

The researchers believe that dogs are healthier for humans because they spend more time outdoors .

`` The protective effect of dogs could be due to their natural antigens in their dead skin , but might also be because they spend more time outdoors and are happy to get dirty , whereas cats are cleaner animals , '' said Dr Anne Coleman , of UCLA .
