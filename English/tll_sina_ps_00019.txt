Dr Simon Kyle , a sleep researcher at the university , said : ` A lot of people are interested in this at the moment given that as a 24_hour society , sleep deprivation is increasing and we are exposing ourselves to artificial light at night .

` We are interested in how an alteration in the sleep_wake pattern may be involved in the onset of diabetes and obesity and if , when you improve the timing of sleep you can also have a positive effect on conditions like diabetes and obesity .
