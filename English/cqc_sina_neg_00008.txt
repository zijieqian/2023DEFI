Instead of letting her know that you 've noticed she 's gone up a size or two LRB and trust us , she knows already RRB , shift the focus to committing to being healthier together .

Looking good takes time and women spend a good portion of that time in preparation __ from picking out clothes and shoes to the color of her hair and nails .
########

Even the best of preparation does n't ensure she 'll be happy with the result , so saying she looks bad in an outfit shows zero consideration .
