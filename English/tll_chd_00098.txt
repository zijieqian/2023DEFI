Modern technology allows security services to monitor calls , emails , car journeys , bank transactions , internet browsing , and much else .

It would risk damaging relations with the UK 's 2.86 million Muslims because of the activities of a few hundred people who do not represent that community , which is exactly what the Islamist extremists would like to see happen .

The attacker in London used a hired car and a knife as his weapons , which made him more or less invisible to the authorities before he carried out his attack , but the Manchester bomber was able to collect bomb_making materials and know_how , things that have been closely watched since the days of the IRA .

The strength of the explosion , the inclusion of bolts in the bomb that maximized the carnage , and the fact that the bomber was able to smuggle the device into a relatively secure area , suggests a degree of skill in bomb_making .
