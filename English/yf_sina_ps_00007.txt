Scientists have found fructose appears to be linked to serious modern epidemics such as cancers , heart disease , hypertension , kidney damage , type 2 diabetes and even dementia .

These effects are particularly concerning during the teenage years , when a person 's stress response develops .

If the body 's stress response becomes too sensitive , teenagers risk growing up susceptible to high levels of stress .

Prolonged exposure to stress can raise blood pressure , suppress the immune system , increase the risk of heart attack and stroke , contribute to infertility , and speed up the aging process .

As part of the study , lead author Constance Harrell of Emory University in Atlanta , US , and her team gave teenage and adult rats either a standard diet , or one high in fructose .

The teenage rats fed the high fructose had a different stress hormone response to the test , including producing more of the stress hormone cortisol than the adult rats .

Scientists found that a genetic pathway in the brain that plays a key role in regulating the way it responds to stress was also altered as a result of the diet .

HOW THE BODY REACTS TO FRUCTOSE <EOP> .

Although it is a simple sugar , glucose , rather than fructose is the body 's preferred energy source .

Excess fructose in the body is turned into fat , which can lodge in the liver , leading to non_alcoholic fatty liver disease .

Fructose puts an extra load on the liver , which in turn , prompts a range of problems , including raised levels of fat in the bloodstream .

The sugar can also lead to insulin resistance _ where the body stops detecting insulin levels in the blood _ and so produces even more insulin .

High levels of insulin in the blood also blocks the action of ` hunger hormone ' leptin , which tells the brain when fat cells have enough energy .

So high levels of insulin lead to leptin resistance and therefore obesity .
