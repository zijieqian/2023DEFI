A 2013 review of studies related to dog ownership concluded that as a group , dog owners spend almost an hour more per week walking than people without dogs .

That bond prompted a group of scientists , veterinarians and physicians at the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences , in Bethesda , Md. , and other institutions to consider whether people might be willing to undertake a health_and_fitness regimen targeted at their dog , even if they had little enthusiasm for such a program for themselves .

The researchers recruited 32 dog owners who visited a veterinary clinic in Maryland .

Half the volunteers were told by a veterinarian to watch their dog 's nutrition and monitor its health .

The rest were told that their dog was overweight and needed more exercise .

These owners were given specific exercise prescriptions , which generally advised walking the dog for at least 30 minutes every day .

They reported walking far more often than they did before they got health warnings for their dogs , and both they and their pets were thinner .

The upshot , says Capt. Mark B. Stephens M.D. , a professor of family medicine at Uniformed Services University and a co_author of the study -- it was published in September in the journal Anthrozo?s -- is that `` love and concern for a dog can be a powerful motivation for exercise . ''
