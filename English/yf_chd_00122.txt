Dan Mahaffee , senior vice president and director of policy at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress , also told Xinhua that the upcoming security strategy reflects the US position that future geopolitical challenges will be less about the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East , Africa and Afghanistan , but `` much more about the challenges posed by peer competitors in a range of domains from maritime conflicts to cyberspace and space .
