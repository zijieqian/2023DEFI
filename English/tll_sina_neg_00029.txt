Results show that later sleep times were associated with more self_reported minutes sitting , and sleep timing remained a significant predictor of sedentary minutes after controlling for age and sleep duration .

However , people who characterized themselves as night owls reported more sitting time and more perceived barriers to exercise , including not having enough time for exercise and being unable to stick to an exercise schedule regardless of what time they actually went to bed or woke up .

` We found that even among healthy , active individuals , sleep timing and circadian preference are related to activity patterns and attitudes toward physical activity , ' said principal investigator Kelly Glazer Baron , associate professor of neurology and director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago , Illinois .

` Waking up late and being an evening person were related to more time spent sitting , particularly on weekends and with difficulty making time to exercise . '
