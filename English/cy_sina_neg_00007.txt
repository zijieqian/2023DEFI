He notes that he already has an iPhone 8 , which he likes even while admitting it 's very similar to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 6 before it .

That 's a valid concern given Apple 's track record with rolling out glitchy new features , though it seems unlikely that the company would risk such a huge blunder if Face ID were n't totally market ready .

Last year he warned Apple not to remove the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 , but came out in support of the decision after the phone was officially announced .

So it 's possible we could see The Woz pick up an iPhone X pretty soon , as long as Face ID is n't a total disaster .
