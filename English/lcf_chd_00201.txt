I did get lost in parts where there was a lot of Mandarin , but they picked up on universal actions for certain things that people do . ''

Also at the Fringe , the National Theater of China 's production of Luocha Land is firmly rooted in Chinese culture and exclusively in Mandarin , with masks and puppetry providing cues for non_speakers .

Beauty and ugliness are reversed in Luocha Land , and the protagonist moves from an initial state of terror and confusion , to deep contemplation on the meaning of these concepts .

Director Zhao Miao said : `` I wanted to share my impression of the part that beauty and ugliness play in Chinese philosophy with British spectators .

`` To become individuals and share their emotions with the audience has been an interesting challenge for them and a fun experience for me . ''
