The Nobel assembly at the Karolinska Institute has decided to award the 2017 physiology or medicine prize jointly to Jeffrey C. Hall , Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm .

For many years , people have known that living organisms , including humans , have an internal , biological clock that helps them anticipate and adapt to the regular rhythm of the day , without knowing how this clock actually work .

`` Jeffrey C. Hall , Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young were able to peek inside our biological clock and elucidate its inner workings .

Their discoveries explain how plants , animals and humans adapt their biological rhythm so that it is synchronized with the Earth 's revolutions , '' said a statement released by The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet .

Using fruit flies as a model organism , this year 's Nobel laureates isolated a gene that controls the normal daily biological rhythm .
########

<EOP> .
########
14
They showed that this gene encodes a protein that accumulates in the cell during the night , and is then degraded during the day .
########
15
Subsequently , they identified additional protein components of this machinery , exposing the mechanism governing the self_sustaining clockwork inside the cell .

`` We now recognize that biological clocks function by the same principles in cells of other multicellular organisms , including humans , '' according to the statement .

Since the seminal discoveries by the three laureates , circadian biology has developed into a vast and highly dynamic research field , with implications for our health and wellbeing , the statement said .

<EOP> .
########
21
The paradigm_shifting discoveries by the laureates established key mechanistic principles for the biological clock .
########
22
During the following years other molecular components of the clockwork mechanism were elucidated , explaining its stability and function , it said .

`` With exquisite precision , our inner clock adapts our physiology to the dramatically different phases of the day .
########
25
The clock regulates critical functions such as behavior , hormone levels , sleep , body temperature and metabolism . ''

`` Our wellbeing is affected when there is a temporary mismatch between our external environment and this internal biological clock , for example when we travel across several time zones and experience `` jet lag '' , it said .
########

<EOP> .
########
29
There are also indications that chronic misalignment between people 's lifestyle and the rhythm dictated by inner timekeeper is associated with increased risk for various diseases , it said .

Juleen Zierath , member of the committee , told Xinhua at the press conference that in light of this year 's scientific discoveries , for people living in the Nordic environment and exposed to long daylights and darkness , people need to raise awareness of the importance to keep good sleep in due time , even when the sun is still shining .
