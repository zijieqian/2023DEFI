Do women carrying boys eat more 
0
Most of the folk wisdom that well_meaning older relatives offer up to expectant mothers can be easily ignored : Carrying the baby lower in the abdomen is n't a sign that it 's a boy , or a girl , or anything other than an indication your abdominal muscles have loosened up a bit .

But in recent years , a handful of studies have found that some of the most outlandish old ideas concerning babies and pregnancy may have some scientific merit after all .

Researchers are n't quite sure why this one 's true , but nonetheless : In 2003 , a team of doctors analyzed more than 8,000 births at a single hospital in Ireland between 1997 and 2000 , excluding women who delivered prematurely or needed to induce labor .

On average , labor for boy births lasted a little over six hours , while girl births took a little under six .

Women delivering boys were also more likely to run into complications during delivery , requiring C_sections 6 percent of the time LRB compared to 4 percent for girls RRB and forceps in 8 percent of cases LRB as opposed to 6 percent RRB .

One possible reason for the discrepancy : Boys , on average , weigh three and a half ounces more at birth than girls do .

And a small 2003 study found that women carrying boys also consume more calories during pregnancy , suggesting that male babies are a little more demanding even before delivery starts .

It 's not just that women carrying boys will eat more ; eating more in the lead_up to pregnancy may also make it more likely that the baby is a boy .

In 2008 , a study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society asked 740 women who were pregnant for the first time to describe their diets over the year before they conceived , then divided them into three groups based on calorie intake .

The women in the top third of the study , calorie_wise , had boys 56 percent of the time ; among the third that consumed the fewest calories , 55 percent had girls .

Here 's where the old line about bananas __ that eating them before conception will up your chances of having a boy __ comes in .

The study authors found that sheer calorie intake was n't the only thing that made a difference ; specific nutrients did , too .

Eating plenty of potassium LRB which bananas are chock_full of RRB was linked to boys , as were diets high in calcium and sodium .

Though as the Guardian noted , overhauling your diet to influence the sex of a future kid can be a risky move , health_wise , spurring people to overload on some nutrients and to ignore others __ a safer idea may be to focus on eating healthily in general , and leaving the rest up to chance .

Heartburn is a harbinger of a hairy baby <EOP> .

Here 's a horrifying fact about babies : Sometime in the second trimester of pregnancy , they develop a coat of fine hair all over their bodies , called lanugo __ and sometime in the third trimester , they shed it and eat it .
########
39
A baby 's first poop , in fact , is the digested remains of their own body hair .

The hair on their heads , though , is another story .
########
42
While all babies have lanugo in the womb , not all babies are born with anything up top __ and mothers looking to know ahead of time whether their kid will be fuzzy_headed or bald may be able to use their own heartburn as a clue .

In 2006 , for a study in the journal Birth , a team of researchers from Johns Hopkins University followed 64 women throughout their pregnancies , 28 of whom reported moderate or severe heartburn .

On the opposite end of the spectrum , of the 12 women who reported no heartburn at all , ten of them gave birth to kids who were less hairy than the average newborn .

The heartburn was n't a result of the hair , or vice versa .

Rather , the study authors argued , both were caused by a third factor : pregnancy hormones .

########

Specifically , the same hormones that contribute to hair growth in the womb have also been shown to relax the muscles that keep stomach acid contained in the stomach .

So you can technically blame the baby for that fiery pain in your chest , but the link is n't quite as direct as the old wives ' tale implies .
