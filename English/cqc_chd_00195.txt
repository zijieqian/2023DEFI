With the strength of the US dollar moderating and the euro remaining relatively stable , currencies such as the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar have gained in value , ending up with higher relative cost .

Underpinned by a stronger yen , Tokyo and Osaka have returned to the 10 most expensive cities ' list , by climbing up seven and nine places .

And Seoul , supported by currency and income growth , has moved up two places to the 6th spot .

Asian cities ' rankings are characterized by extremes , the most expensive and the cheapest .
########
26
Singapore and Hong Kong continue to be the most and second_most expensive cities , while cities such as Colombo , Kathmandu , New Delhi , Chennai , Mumbai , Karachi and Bangalore represent the best value for money in Asia and are among the 30 cheapest in the world because of lower incomes and closer links to domestic agriculture and manufacturing supply chains .

A closer look at the most expensive cities shows Asian cities tend to form the priciest locations for tradable goods , such as grocery and daily necessities .

Yet they offer non_tradable goods at much lower prices than European cities .

This perhaps reflects a greater premium on discretionary spending for better quality products , such as organic food , branded clothes and advanced electronic products , in high_income cities such as Hong Kong and Tokyo .

The grocery products many Asian countries , such as China and Malaysia , export often do not match the demand for wealthier Asian countries ' premium consumption .

Government subsidy is another important factor that decides Asian cities ' ranks .

Grocery prices in cities in Japan and the Republic of Korea , for instance , are among the highest in the world .

In Seoul , topping up a grocery basket is almost 50 percent more expensive than in New York City .
########
37
The average price of a 1_kilogram loaf of bread in Seoul is 140 percent more than in New Delhi , and much higher than in China , Malaysia , New Zealand , which export agricultural products .
########

Due to limited domestic arable land , the ROK relies on imports of agricultural products , but with high tariffs to protect its domestic agricultural industry , it ends up with very high grocery prices .

In India , one sees the opposite trend .
########
40
To reduce hunger , India provides subsidies for staple foods and other agricultural products , lowering the cost of foods .

In the long run , this divergence is likely to persist and Asian cities are expected to become relatively more expensive as emerging economies continue to supply much of the world 's wage and demand growth .
