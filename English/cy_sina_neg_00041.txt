That 's the exciting implication of new research out of the University of Washington , where researchers have created a mobile phone prototype that does n't require a battery to operate .

The astonishingly efficient prototype requires just 3.5 microwatts of juice , and it employs an innovative approach to avoid the need for a battery cell .

Instead , it uses ambient power from radio signals and light -- its onboard solar cell is `` roughly the size of a grain of rice '' -- to transmit a signal back to a base station 50 feet away .

The prototype itself is made of simple materials : capacitive touch buttons , a circuit board , and other `` off the shelf '' components .

More impressive is that the team of scientists were able to create a custom base station to transmit the signal with such a small amount of power .

Using this setup , the researchers were able to successfully make and receive calls LRB via Skype RRB and place callers on hold .

But the scientists say they want to improve the prototype by adding an e_ink display with video_streaming capabilities and encryption to make the calls more secure .

Vamsi Tall , who coauthored the paper , says the base station technology they developed -- while it 's still an early prototype -- could make it possible for battery_free mobile phones to become ubiquitous .
