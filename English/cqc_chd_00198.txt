According to Bai , the average temperature in Kazakhstan is lower than in Shaanxi , but between noon and midnight the difference is much larger , so the Chinese seeds grow better in Almaty .

In addition to the rules on renting land , Yangling is unable to sell its crops in Kazakhstan because foreign seeds need at least three good harvests before they can be sold in the Kazakh market .
