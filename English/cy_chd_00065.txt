Gary Hufbauer , a trade expert with the Peterson Institute for International Economics , said that the United States runs an overall trade deficit with the rest of the world because the combined net savings of the U.S. households , businesses and government sectors are negative , and the dollar is persistently overvalued in foreign exchange markets .

Hufbauer considered Trump administration 's approach to the bilateral trade balance as a display of mercantilist doctrines , adding that a trade balance makes little economic sense as a guide to trade policy in the 21st century , nor as a focal point for shrinking the US trade deficit .
