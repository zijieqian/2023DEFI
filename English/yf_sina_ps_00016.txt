What 's more , this appears to be a national phenomenon : The fraction of people who say they urinate in the shower is pretty consistent whether you 're looking at U.S. regions , or age , income , sex , race , education or marital status .

But before you get too excited and start brandishing labels like `` freak , '' you should take a closer look at the numbers on shower_peeing frequency .

It turns out that 47 percent of people who said they had relieved themselves in the shower also added that they did so `` not regularly at all -- I have only done this once or twice . ''
