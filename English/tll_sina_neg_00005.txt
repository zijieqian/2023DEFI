This more than likely stems from old electronic devices , such as CRT monitors and televisions , which were susceptible to magnetic fields , explains Matt Newby from first4magnets , `` When placing a strong magnet near one of these you could distort the picture .

Most modern electronics , like our smartphones , are not going to be adversely affected by small magnets ; but is that all there is to it ?

The vast majority of magnets that you come across day to day , even many of the super_strong ones on the market , will have no adverse effect on your smartphone , says Matt , `` In fact , within the device there will be a number of very small magnets which perform important functions.For example , the new Apple Watch uses a magnetic inductive wireless charging system .

Matt warned that magnetic fields can temporarily interfere with the digital compass and magnetometer inside your smartphone , and that 's more serious than you may think .

The engineers over at KandJ Magnetics actually experimented with an iPhone to show how the sensors inside can be affected by a magnet .

The problem we found is that a nearby magnet will affect the internal magnetic sensors inside the phone .

The compass wo n't read correctly , explained Michael Paul , an engineer at KandJ , `` What 's worse , if you stick a strong magnet to the phone , you could slightly magnetize some steel components inside , making them act like weak magnets .

You might think it 's unimportant because you never use the compass app , but that does n't mean other apps are n't relying on the same sensor .

Google LRB GOOGL , Tech30 RRB Maps , for example , uses the sensor to detect which way the phone is facing , and a number of games also rely on it to work out your orientation .

It seems as though magnets are n't likely to kill your smartphone , but there 's definitely a possibility they 'll mess some pretty important aspects up , so why take the risk ?
