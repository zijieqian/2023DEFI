Russia , who administers the islands , maintains that the islands that they refer to as the Southern Kurils are their territory with Russian leaders repeatedly referring to the area as a strategic region of Russia .

Abe and Putin have both stated and agreed in principle , however , that it is unusual that both countries have not signed a postwar peace treaty due to the spat , and have agreed to discuss the matter candidly going forward .

But progress in this respect has been sluggish owing to geopolitical stumbling blocks as well as the firm belief on both sides that , while the absence of a peace treaty is an anachronism , many complexities on the issue remain .

For Japan 's part , it has long insisted that its sovereignty over all four of the islands be confirmed before a peace treaty is signed .

But economic cooperation , since a summit held between the two leaders in December , remains high on both countries ' agendas .

Collaborative activities in areas such as fisheries and tourism were already discussed , with the crux of the intended collaboration being that neither side 's claim to sovereignty should be undercut .

It is such cooperation that Tokyo and Moscow hope will eventually lay the foundation for enhanced relations and , thereafter , could create an atmosphere amicable enough in which the territorial dispute and peace treaty could be tackled head on .

But the road ahead in this regard remains tricky , as the isles have strategic value for Russia , guaranteeing its navy access to the western Pacific , while top of Japan 's security agenda is always its ally , the United States .

It is a point of contention Putin has previously raised with Abe , regarding the growing presence of the US in Asia , with Russia also believing that certain moves on Tokyo 's part , such as its missile defense system , is disproportionate to perceived regional threats .
